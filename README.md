#JRPG

### Welcome !

This project is a weird 2 players textual RPG where you play turn by turn as a Hero

You can either be a Warrior, a Thief or a Mage.

I did it in the course of a few days during my free time. 

It was for me an exercise to go play around with POO and Tests in Java.


### Note


This project is heavily inspired by an assignment I found on the net, you can check "Assignement.md" but beware, it's in French.

I don't consider the project as "finished" there is quite a few Tests I could add and a bunch of methods to refactor.

But I decided to move on to another project. I hope you'll keep that in mind while reading my code.


Advices and PR are very welcome.
